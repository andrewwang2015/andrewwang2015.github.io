                <h1>Hi, I'm Andrew.</h1>
                <br>
                <p>
                    My name is Andrew Wang and I'm currently a software engineer at Microsoft, working on Azure Notification Hubs!
                    <br>
                    <br> Within the field of Computer Science, my primary interests lie in software engineering. Outside of academics, I enjoy competing in athletics. I played NCAA basketball for Caltech where I was featured in the November 2015 issue
                    of Sports Illustrated magazine and on the all-academic team. You can view the SI article <a href='https://www.si.com/college-basketball/2015/11/23/caltech-basketball-losing-streak-oliver-eslinger' target='_blank'> here</a> (I'm on
                    the far left). Nowadays, I play competitive indoor volleyball, and compete in Powerlifting competitions (425/350/425).
                    <br>
                    <br> Outside the gym, I enjoy watching sports (big fan of Washington DC teams). On weekends, I enjoy backpacking/camping/hiking. So far, I've been to 24 US national parks. I have pretty diverse music interests ranging from classical
                    to country to hardcore rap.

                <p> As part of the Trading and Analytics Department and the Enterprise Trading Network team, I built a full stack application: a generic audit trail. It allows any Bloomberg terminal application to integrate with it so that when there's an
                    outage, my audit trail can be used to track all changes, so we can easily diagnose what went wrong. Additionally, it serves as a standalone terminal application to allow cross querying functionality across multiple Bloomberg applications
                    and tables. I was able to push it out to BETA by the end of my internship.

                    34,000 vendors. In addition, I wrote a GUI wrapper for the Ariba Integration Toolkit, that facilitates data transfer of master and transactional data between the Ariba system and the bank’s JDBC-based back-end system. </p>

                    At Northrop Grumman, Mission Systems, I worked on Joint Mission Planning System. Specifically, I was part of the Precision Guided Munitions Planning Software team which operated in an Agile fashion (daily SRUMs, fast iterations, etc.). My biggest task
                    was implementing the auto-calculate functionality so that project plans will auto-update upon modification. I learned a bit of XAML and .Net framework for the front end of the system. My code ultimately got pushed into production and
                    is currently in use by the U.S. Department of Defense. I also attained a Secret level security clearance.</p>

                <p>I performed two consecutive summers of research on sickle cell anemia. Although most of my work was relating to wetlab work, I was able to integrate dynamic programming and bioinformatics into my work in generating interspecies comparisons
                    of genomes. The bio-related matters involved analyzing the lncRNA in the HBS1L-MYB intergenic region for fetal hemoglobin expression and developing the Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type 1 (HTLV-1) – based gene delivery vehicle for hemoglobin
                    expression. If any of this fancy terminology excites you, you can check out my <a href="images/work/poster.pdf" target=_ blank>research poster</a>. I presented my exciting work at the annual NIH research festival.

                <p>This was my first "real" internship. As part of the center for nanoscale science and technology, I performed atomic force microscopy measurements on select samples for 3D topography, identified phyllosilicates via probe-sample interaction
                    with AFM giving resolution 1000x the optical diffraction limit, and quantified stick-slip frictional measurements of phyllosilicates. I also learned the equally important skills of keeping a detailed lab notebook, overcoming the fear
                    of asking questions, and presenting to a scientific audience.</p>
